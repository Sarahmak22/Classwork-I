    <h1>About Us</h1>
    <p>I can't say I have a favorite hobby because I enjoy doing a couple of things that makes me happy. I love traveling, hanging out with family and friends, making people smile, love good food, listening to good music, enjoy reading - give me some thriller/suspense and I love it. I love watching movies that feature Jason Statham (even if the show isn't all that 😂). I'm also improving my relationship with God and want to make anything that brings me close to him my hobby. Oh well, travelling and seeing new people, sights, images etc is another way of appreciating God's creation. I guess I'm already on the path😁. I got more to say, but let's end here 😉.  </p>
