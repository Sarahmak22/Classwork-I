    <h1>Welcome to my Site</h1>
    <p>I learnt that the <em>emphasis tag is</em> used to make an emphasis on the word. It shouldn't be used instead of <i> italics tag because</i> this tag is used to make a word appear in italics. Another tag I learnt about is the <strong> strong tag </strong> which can sometimes be confused with the <b> bold tag. However, it is used to make a text appear important to the user.</b><br> The break tag is used when you want a break in your paragraph or want to start on a new line. <s> Strike through tag is used to strike through a word. </s>The example that came to mind was for slashed prices during sales.</p>
